# ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

**Kuka** is a Python library designed to support exploratory data analysis (EDA), data modeling, and interpretation of machine learning models.  

Its main goal is to serve as a practical reference toolkit throughout the various stages of a machine learning pipeline.

While major libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` offer robust general-purpose tools, **Kuka** fills the gaps by providing streamlined and customized utilities for tasks that are commonly needed but not readily available out-of-the-box.
